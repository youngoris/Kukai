# Screen Components Error Handling

## Focus Screen Session State Management

The Focus Screen manages session state persistence through several key functions that have been enhanced with robust error handling:

### Session State Persistence

1. **saveSessionState()**: Saves the current focus session state to persistent storage.
   - Uses `withErrorHandling` to catch and process all exceptions
   - Implements `withRetry` with exponential backoff to handle transient storage errors
   - Ensures session data is properly saved before app goes to background or is closed

2. **restoreSessionState()**: Restores previously saved session state when the app is resumed.
   - Uses `withErrorHandling` to catch all exceptions during the restoration process
   - Implements `withRetry` for storage operations to handle transient retrieval issues
   - Gracefully handles corrupted JSON data by providing safe defaults
   - Loads user settings even if session state can't be restored
   - Restores session progress only if settings haven't changed

3. **checkAppRestart()**: Determines if the app has been fully restarted or just resumed.
   - Uses `withErrorHandling` to handle any time-related or storage access errors
   - Implements `withRetry` for reliable storage operations
   - Provides a fallback (assumes not restarted) if the check fails

4. **initializeSession()**: Coordinates the overall session initialization process.
   - Uses `withErrorHandling` to catch and process any initialization errors
   - Provides safe default values through `onError` callback if initialization fails
   - Clears invalid session state with retry mechanisms for reliability

### Error Handling Strategies

The following strategies are employed to ensure session state consistency:

1. **Exponential Backoff with Retry**: All storage operations use retry with exponential backoff to handle transient issues.
2. **Defensive Parsing**: JSON parsing is wrapped in try/catch blocks with appropriate fallbacks.
3. **Default Values**: All state values have sensible defaults if data can't be restored.
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Even when errors occur, the app remains functional with basic settings.
5. **Transparent Logging**: All errors are logged for debugging purposes but hidden from users.

### Common Issues Fixed

1. **Inconsistent Session State Loading**: Sessions sometimes failed to load due to storage timing issues.
   - Fixed by adding retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
   - Added better error handling to prevent blank/null states.

2. **Corrupted JSON Data**: Occasionally the stored JSON became corrupted.
   - Added explicit JSON parsing error handling with fallback to default values.
   - Implemented automatic cleanup of corrupted state entries.

3. **Race Conditions**: Storage operations sometimes competed with each other.
   - Ensured sequential execution of storage operations.
   - Added retry mechanisms to handle transient failures.

### Improved User Experience

These error handling improvements ensure that:

1. Users never lose their session state under normal circumstances
2. When errors do occur, they are handled gracefully without user impact
3. The app always starts with valid state, even after crashes or unexpected terminations
4. Session data is consistent with user's latest settings
