# Your rule content


1. Writing Style and Tone
Clarity: Use simple, straightforward language. Define technical terms on first use. Don't hallucinate and don't go against the facts underlying the project. 
Tone: Keep it professional and objective, a very professional level of language to academic or industry standards, foreign student tune, combine sections into a cohesive paragraph and ensure it flows naturally.
Consistency: Stick to the same terms throughout (e.g., “the app” or “Kukai” consistently).
Active Voice: Prefer active constructions for readability (e.g., “The app tracks habits” vs. “Habits are tracked by the app”).

1. Formatting and Markdown Usage
Headers: Use # for main sections, ## for subsections, and ### for deeper levels.
Lists: Use - for bullet points or 1. for numbered steps.
Emphasis: Apply **bold** for key terms and *italics* for subtle emphasis.
Links: Link to resources like [React Native](mdc:https:/reactnative.dev).
Code Blocks: Format code with triple backticks:
Images: Add visuals with ![Description](mdc:image-url) (e.g., screenshots).
Tables: Present data cleanly

1. Citations and References
In-Text Citations: Use a consistent style: cite in correct ACM style
Reference List: List sources alphabetically at the end
